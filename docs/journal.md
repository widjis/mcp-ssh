- **Common Scenarios**: Home lab, AWS EC2, VPS examples
- **Error Prevention**: Troubleshooting tips for connection issues

### Schema Validation Fix (2025-08-13 - Update)
- **Fixed MCP Schema Errors**: Converted Zod schemas to proper JSON Schema format
- **Tool Registration**: All 6 tools now properly register with `type: 'object'` in inputSchema
- **Validation Compliance**: Fixed "Invalid literal value, expected 'object'" errors
- **Build Success**: TypeScript compilation and type checking passes without errors
- **Schema Consistency**: Maintained all parameter descriptions and requirements

### Technical Improvements
- **JSON Schema Format**: Proper MCP-compliant tool schema definitions
- **Type Safety**: Maintained Zod validation for runtime parameter checking
- **Error Prevention**: Fixed schema validation that was preventing tool registration
- **Compatibility**: Ensures proper integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

## 2025-08-14 - Enhanced Interactive Features

### Enhanced SSH MCP Server - Option 3 Implementation

- **Major Enhancement**: Successfully implemented Option 3 - Enhanced MCP Server with full PTY support and interactive session management
